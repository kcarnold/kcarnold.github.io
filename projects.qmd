## AI for Writers

We develop tools to help writers serve their readers better without putting words in their mouths.

Publications:

- [Supporting Revision with AI-Generated Views](/pubs/haigen24/index.qmd) (HAI-GEN workshop at IUI 2024)
- [Generative Models can Help Writers without Writing for Them](/pubs/iui21-help-writers/index.qmd) (HAI-GEN workshop at IUI 2021)

See [Writing Prototypes](https://huggingface.co/spaces/kcarnold/writing-prototypes) for a demo of two recent interfaces. Also, students are currently working on deploying the TextFocals sidebar(described in the publications above) as part of a broader study; let me know if you're interested in participating.


## Predictive Text

We study how predictive text shapes what people write and develop interfaces that help people use it differently.

Publications:

- [Predictive Text Encourages Predictable Writing](/pubs/predictable/index.qmd) (IUI 2020)
- [Sentiment Bias in Predictive Text Recommendations Results in Biased Writing](/pubs/sentiment-bias/index.qmd) (GI 2018)
- [On Suggesting Phrases vs. Predicting Words for Mobile Text Composition](/pubs/phrase-suggestion/index.qmd) (UIST 2016)


See the [Writing Prototypes](https://huggingface.co/spaces/kcarnold/writing-prototypes) space for one demo that re-imagines the chatbot interface as a predictive text interface.

## Educational Technology

- [Moodle-Palette](https://github.com/kcarnold/Moodle-Palette) is a keyboard-based interface for Moodle. It also serves as a playground for various ways of incorporating privacy-sensitive AI into instructors' workflows for content creation and feedback.
- [zylabs-libs](https://github.com/kcarnold/zylabs-libs) is a collection of Python shim code to help instructors develop ZyLabs questions that give students better feedback.
- [Calgen](https://github.com/kcarnold/calgen): a tool for helping instructors (and eventually students) import their course schedules into their calendars.

## Other Projects

- [X32 channel-mover script](https://github.com/kcarnold/channel-mover): a Streamlit app for moving channels around on a Behringer X32 soundboard.
- [Nanomixer](https://github.com/nanomixer/nanomixer): A digital audio mixer, with ADAT I/O and processing on FPGA and web-based control
