    "text": "Large lanugage models like ChatGPT (and its peers like PaLM, BLOOMZ, etc.) are surprisingly powerful tools for knowledge fusion. For example, if I ask GPT-3 to continue “A list of exercises for beginning computer science students: 1.”, it will generate that list based on all exercises that ever have been listed in plausibly similar contexts. Communities of practice have been exchanging ideas and knowledge throughout human history, but the tools and scale have increased with technological developments like the printing press, video capture, and the Internet, and social developments like academic conferences and social media. Language models are continuing the trend of increasing knowledge sharing by becoming, in a sense, dynamic summaries of slices of others’ ideas. Like reading a textbook or a review article, we can benefit from the insights and ideas of others without directly having to read them. But it can do this without nearly as much human effort as writing such reviews."

    "text": "Implications\n\nWe’ll be able to collaborate at even greater scales than before. AI systems will help cross-pollinate ideas between disparate communities of practice. Instructors will still make our own educational materials, for example, but instead of blank pages, we’ll start with ideas synthesized from everyone else who’s ever taught a related subject.\nBut, LMs will need to get better at citing their sources. There’s thankfully some work going on in that area: Attributed Question Answering: Evaluation and Modeling for Attributed Large Language Models | Abstract\nAnd: since LMs conflate popularity (i.e., what’s common) with quality—and that’s really tricky to untangle—we’ll need more discernment about when, and when not, to seek and use LM suggestions."

    "text": "Happy New Decade!\nHighlights:\n\nWe’ve moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan! We miss Boston and our friends there (who helped us immensely with the move, by the way), but we’ve started to appreciate Grand Rapids on its own terms.\nKen started teaching Computer Science and Data Science at Calvin University! The first semester was joyfully overwhelming. Ken feels increasingly thankful and blessed to be there.\nSusan has mostly been at home with Naomi and Esther. For ten weeks last spring, she went back to work part time for her former architecture firm, with the help of a wonderful nanny. She felt like that was a nice balance and is hoping to find a similar part time schedule here, once she finishes her architecture professional exams.\nNaomi and Esther celebrated their second birthday in November. They have learned so much, going from not talking at the beginning of the year, to putting ever more complex phrases together.\n\nOther tidbits:\n\n2019 started with a New Year’s Day hike in Maryland with Ken’s brother Austin and (now) fiancée Mason, and finished with Ken’s parents visiting us in Grand Rapids for New Years 2020.\nKen’s parents visited us frequently during the year (coming from Maryland) and Susan’s parents visited Boston over the summer to help us pack up for our move.\nNaomi and Esther were baptized at Citylife Church in Boston in June, with all grandparents attending. Baptism is a symbol of the faith we share and our hopes that the girls will grow in that faith as part of Christian community.\nWe enjoyed Christmas in Portland, Oregon with Susan’s parents.\nWe are now located closer to Susan’s extended family in Michigan.\nWe bought a minivan (a like-new Honda Odyssey)!\n\nLooking forward to:\n\nKen teaching another two classes this spring, and hopefully finally defending his PhD thesis (long story).\nUpcoming travels: to Ken’s brother Austin’s wedding mid-October, Ken traveling to Italy in March to present a paper at a conference (it finally got accepted on the third try), and maybe a few days vacationing by Lake Michigan this summer with one of Susan’s friends.\nGetting connected with a local church.\nSusan continuing in professional development and maybe starting work.\nNaomi and Esther continuing to grow, and we’re considering starting preschool this year.\n\nOur new address is 3654 Palmer Ridge Road SE, Grand Rapids MI 49546.\nWith love,\nKen, Susan, Esther and Naomi\n\n\n\nNaomi and Esther\n\n\nmore photos here."

    "text": "Abstract\nPrior research has demonstrated that intelligent systems make biased decisions because they are trained on biased data. As people increasingly leverage intelligent systems to enhance their productivity and creativity, could system biases affect what people create? We demonstrate that in at least one domain (writing restaurant reviews), biased system behavior leads to biased human behavior: People presented with phrasal text entry shortcuts that were skewed positive wrote more positive reviews than they did when presented with negative-skewed shortcuts. This result contributes to the pertinent debate about the role of intelligent systems in our society."

    "text": "Abstract\nA system capable of suggesting multi-word phrases while someone is writing could supply ideas about content and phrasing and allow those ideas to be inserted efficiently. Meanwhile, statistical language modeling has provided various approaches to predicting phrases that users type. We introduce a simple extension to the familiar mobile keyboard suggestion interface that presents phrase suggestions that can be accepted by a repeated-tap gesture. In an extended composition task, we found that phrases were interpreted as suggestions that affected the content of what participants wrote more than conventional single-word suggestions, which were interpreted as predictions. We highlight a design challenge: how can a phrase suggestion system make valuable suggestions rather than just accurate predictions?"
