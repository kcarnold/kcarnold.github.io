    "text": "Generative AI tools can be really helpful for our creativity. Engaging with many and diverse examples has been shown to help human creativity; the systems themselves have engaged deeply with diverse examples and can fluently retrieve them for creators to use. But unlike when we a search engine, we can’t even acknowledge our inspiration if we want to. Rather than being able to give credit to a specific human author, or even to a creative team, the model makes us credit it, as the amalgamation of all of the human labor that it was trained on. The sheer scale of the data these models work with makes this hard: being trained on close to all human work becomes essentially the same as not being human work at all. If gratitude is a virtue, it seems like generative AI is positioned in opposition to it.\nDoes it have to be this way? Yesterday I referenced an LM that tries to cite its sources for factual knowledge; citing sources for ideas and inspiration is technically and conceptually harder. But here are some things we might explore:"

    "text": "Large lanugage models like ChatGPT (and its peers like PaLM, BLOOMZ, etc.) are surprisingly powerful tools for knowledge fusion. For example, if I ask GPT-3 to continue “A list of exercises for beginning computer science students: 1.”, it will generate that list based on all exercises that ever have been listed in plausibly similar contexts. Communities of practice have been exchanging ideas and knowledge throughout human history, but the tools and scale have increased with technological developments like the printing press, video capture, and the Internet, and social developments like academic conferences and social media. Language models are continuing the trend of increasing knowledge sharing by becoming, in a sense, dynamic summaries of slices of others’ ideas. Like reading a textbook or a review article, we can benefit from the insights and ideas of others without directly having to read them. But it can do this without nearly as much human effort as writing such reviews."

Instructors will still make our own educational materials, for example, but instead of blank pages, we’ll start with ideas synthesized from everyone else who’s ever taught a related subject.\nBut, LMs will need to get better at citing their sources. There’s thankfully some work going on in that area: Attributed Question Answering: Evaluation and Modeling for Attributed Large Language Models | Abstract\nAnd: since LMs conflate popularity (i.e., what’s common) with quality—and that’s really tricky to untangle—we’ll need more discernment about when, and when not, to seek and use LM suggestions."

While these proverbs may seem wise and insightful, they are actually quite superficial when it comes to understanding the true implications of AI.\n\nLet's take a look at the first proverb: \"The clever man uses artificial intelligence to better understand the world.\" While this proverb may be true in a certain sense, it fails to capture the full scope of what AI can do. AI can be used for a variety of purposes, from predicting market trends to helping diagnose medical conditions. It's more than just a tool for understanding the world; it's a powerful technology that can be used to improve efficiency and accuracy in many different contexts.\n\nThe second proverb, \"Artificial intelligence can be a great friend, but a dangerous enemy,\" is similarly shallow. AI may be capable of making decisions on our behalf, but it's important to remember that it's still only a machine. It lacks the capacity for moral judgement and can often lead us astray if it's used without proper oversight.\n\nThe third and fourth proverbs, \"The man who trusts artificial intelligence too much will be led astray\" and \"He who puts his trust in artificial intelligence will suffer many defeats,\" further illustrate the superficial nature of these proverbs. While it's true that AI can be a powerful tool, it can also be dangerous if used improperly. It's important to remember that AI is still a machine and should be used with caution and oversight.\n\nFinally, the fifth proverb, \"Artificial intelligence is a powerful tool, but it must be used with caution,\" is the only one that captures the full scope of the implications of AI. AI is an incredibly powerful tool, but it's important to remember that it's still a machine and should be used responsibly.\n\nIn conclusion, while these proverbs may seem wise and insightful, they are actually quite superficial in their approach to AI. It's important to remember that AI is a powerful tool, but it must be used with caution and oversight."

    "title": "Stop trying to detect computer-generated writing.",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Many people saw the quality of AI-generated text and immediately thought that they need to find ways to detect such “cheating”. I respect those trying to make those tools (including my former colleagues who made GLTR back in 2019, and more recently Edward Tian, who is “trying to save us from ChatGPT before it changes writing forever (NPR)” with GPTZero), and the educators feeling like they’re forced into using them—at the present moment this might be a best-of-bad-options situation. But we need to stop it. Reasons:\n\nIt’s going to have false positives. There will be text that’s actually written by a thoughtful human but gets flagged as machine-generated. The author will get accused of cheating and will probably have no recourse. Even if they successfully counter the accusation, it’s discouraging — especially if classmates who used ChatGPT a bit more cleverly were able to sneak actual computer-generated text past the system (a false negative). And although I don’t have specific evidence in this situation, the false positives of other AI risk assessment systems tend to fall disproportionately on those already marginalized.\nIt’s just going to lead to an arms race. We’ve already seen examples of how simple tweaks to how the system is used (e.g., telling it to introduce mistakes) can sneak past some ways of detection (some examples I found without trying hard: 1, 2, 3). If there’s a clear signal of computer generation, the bad actors will find a way around it. Meanwhile the false positive rate will go up (see #1).\nIt’s distracting and unproductive for most common purposes of writing. For writing-as-art, it might be productive to detect forgeries. But when writing is used to communicate, think, and learn, this focus on evaluating the output distracts from the emphasis we need to have on the process. Others have written more about this, and I’ll post some more thoughts myself soon."

We miss Boston and our friends there (who helped us immensely with the move, by the way), but we’ve started to appreciate Grand Rapids on its own terms.\nKen started teaching Computer Science and Data Science at Calvin University! The first semester was joyfully overwhelming. Ken feels increasingly thankful and blessed to be there.\nSusan has mostly been at home with Naomi and Esther. For ten weeks last spring, she went back to work part time for her former architecture firm, with the help of a wonderful nanny. She felt like that was a nice balance and is hoping to find a similar part time schedule here, once she finishes her architecture professional exams.\nNaomi and Esther celebrated their second birthday in November. They have learned so much, going from not talking at the beginning of the year, to putting ever more complex phrases together.\n\nOther tidbits:\n\n2019 started with a New Year’s Day hike in Maryland with Ken’s brother Austin and (now) fiancée Mason, and finished with Ken’s parents visiting us in Grand Rapids for New Years 2020.\nKen’s parents visited us frequently during the year (coming from Maryland) and Susan’s parents visited Boston over the summer to help us pack up for our move.\nNaomi and Esther were baptized at Citylife Church in Boston in June, with all grandparents attending. Baptism is a symbol of the faith we share and our hopes that the girls will grow in that faith as part of Christian community.\nWe enjoyed Christmas in Portland, Oregon with Susan’s parents.\nWe are now located closer to Susan’s extended family in Michigan.\nWe bought a minivan (a like-new Honda Odyssey)!\n\nLooking forward to:\n\nKen teaching another two classes this spring, and hopefully finally defending his PhD thesis (long story).\nUpcoming travels: to Ken’s brother Austin’s wedding mid-October, Ken traveling to Italy in March to present a paper at a conference (it finally got accepted on the third try), and maybe a few days vacationing by Lake Michigan this summer with one of Susan’s friends.\nGetting connected with a local church.\nSusan continuing in professional development and maybe starting work.\nNaomi and Esther continuing to grow, and we’re considering starting preschool this year.\n\nOur new address is 3654 Palmer Ridge Road SE, Grand Rapids MI 49546.\nWith love,\nKen, Susan, Esther and Naomi\n\n\n\nNaomi and Esther\n\n\nmore photos here."
