Engaging with many and diverse examples has been shown to help human creativity; the systems themselves have engaged deeply with diverse examples and can fluently retrieve them for creators to use. But unlike when we a search engine, we can’t even acknowledge our inspiration if we want to. Rather than being able to give credit to a specific human author, or even to a creative team, the model makes us credit it, as the amalgamation of all of the human labor that it was trained on. The sheer scale of the data these models work with makes this hard: being trained on close to all human work becomes essentially the same as not being human work at all. If gratitude is a virtue, it seems like generative AI is positioned in opposition to it.\nDoes it have to be this way? Yesterday I referenced an LM that tries to cite its sources for factual knowledge; citing sources for ideas and inspiration is technically and conceptually harder. But here are some things we might explore:"

Communities of practice have been exchanging ideas and knowledge throughout human history, but the tools and scale have increased with technological developments like the printing press, video capture, and the Internet, and social developments like academic conferences and social media. Language models are continuing the trend of increasing knowledge sharing by becoming, in a sense, dynamic summaries of slices of others’ ideas.

    "section": "",
    "text": "David Brooks wrote an NYT Opinion titled “In the Age of A.I., Major in Being Human”. I agree with the premise and the overall goal. But he then encourages people to develop “distinctly human skills”. I don’t think being human is mainly about which skills we have or don’t have. That would be a “humanity of the gaps”: by analogy to the problematic “god of the gaps”, we’re defining humanity as what part of our skillset hasn’t yet been automated. But God isn’t the part of the universe that science hasn’t explained yet; likewise, humanity isn’t what hasn’t been automated.\nA distinguishing characteristic of humans is that we are formed by interaction:\n\nwith a rich and spiky ecosystem\nwith play\nwith each other\nin rich deep lived experience that builds over contexts that far far exceed the token limit.\n\nFormation by interaction means that everyone is a bit different, since even arriving at a comparable outcome (in terms of measurable skill) took different paths. We can’t download skills into our brains Matrix-style because a skill takes on a character of its own as it grows and develops in our individual minds.\nOutside of carefully controlled simulated worlds like board games and basic (though still impressive) physics simulations, modern ML learns mostly by imitation. So it can replicate the outcome, but it will have all the rough parts smoothed out. We get a regression towards the compact manifold of the projection of exponential individual dimensions onto the video screen of a model’s training data.\nSure, we’ll eventually make models that will imitate the rough parts. Image generation already does that somewhat. With enough examples, in the domains where there’s enough data, it’ll be indistinguishable of course. But beneath the veneer of believable nonsense will be a boring sameness filling in for the multicolored tapestry of the diversity of human experience.\nSo don’t try to develop skills for the sake of developing the skill. Aim to clash creatively with people with diverse experience. Aim not to mimic the world but to sculpt it. Don’t reduce the world to 5-second shorts; celebrate the fierce wildness of the real world. Don’t love people’s attention; love people. Don’t try to get people to invest in you; invest in the “least of these”.\nThis will take skill, yes, lots of it. But it mostly takes guts. Vulnerability. Love. As a human, you already have those things. But no matter what you major in, a good school can help mature them."

Yes, you can build systems that use AI towards flourishing. (I’m working on that for writers and educators, but there’s many more ways. Chat with me!)

    "text": "Information Content\nThe more an artifact conforms to the expectations and norms of a genre, the less information it contains. So many interactive systems seek to remove information, “smoothing out” the rough spots of an artifact.\nSpelling and grammar checkers generally suggest edits that remove information from the document being edited. This is the Anna Karenina principle: there are more ways that a document can be grammatically nonstandard. This is usually desirable, since writers often want to emphasize their main points instead of unusual superficial characteristics.\nMany image editing filters (e.g., in Photoshop) are designed to remove information. For example, it would be surprising for professional images to have “blemishes” or red-eye, so the filters are designed to remove these.\nSummarization tools first add information, then remove information. Specifically, they add decisions about which information in the original to preserve, then remove all other information.\nTranslation tools are trained to preserve information, but sometimes they end up adding or removing information anyway. This is particularly salient when languages differ in which characteristics are explicitly encoded, for example, languages with gendered pronouns or morphology.\nMany interfaces to the generative models that have captured headlines in the past year or so (ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, etc.), in contrast, typically add large amounts of information to the artifact. A wide range of images can be described by the same caption, for example, so caption-to-image interactions add enormous amounts of information. Most ChatGPT screenshots show the human typing a small amount of text and the model generating a large amount of text, also suggesting an increase in information. (To be clear, editing uses of these models can, in net, reduce information.)\nPredictive text interfaces can have a variety of effects. My work has shown that conventional predictive text interfaces generally reduce the low-level information in text written with it. I hypothesized that the mechanism is that when acceptable and conventional options are made salient to human writers, they often tend to take them as both cognitive and physical shortcuts. But the available options can have large effects on the high-level information conveyed. For example, some of the most important information in a document is its overall stance towards its subject (e.g., a review’s sentiment about a restaurant or product; an opinion piece’s overall support for an opinion). My work and others’ have shown that predictive text systems can shape these overall stances.\nI have recently been using GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code while writing both code and class materials. In contrast to many other predictive text interfaces, Copilot regularly shows long suggestions that contain a large amount of new information. To put it bluntly, this is problematic: the information must come from somewhere (prior work from other authors, used without license), and it imposes cognitive load and interference on the author. A simple control would be the amount of information that the model is allowed to include in a suggestion (i.e., a log-probability budget),"

For example, it’s long been clear that this ends up learning syntactic analysis (because that helps predict whether, say, a verb is singular or plural). But it wasn’t obvious that this would learn translation until GPT-2 showed that (because documents often include glosses in a second language). And while most natural text corpora don’t contain a lot of the sort of instruction-response dialogues that characterize the modern chatbot (e.g., ChatGPT or Bard), InstructGPT showed us that the instruction is just a minor variation on the sort of context that these models do see often in training data, so a small amount of fine-tuning is sufficient to get them to recognize instructions as another way to cue that context."

Then sample one token at a time. ImageGPT, Taming Transformers, etc.\nLearn a function from noise to image. (Noise is great because you can sample it, so you can generate many different images by starting with different noise samples.) There are two basic approaches to do this, differing in what they do about the loss.\n\nDiffusion: Learn to map a noisy image to a less-noisy image. Start with an image, add noise, and give the noised image as input and penalize the difference between the output and the starting image. The trick is repeating this for different levels of noise; one you add noise many times, you get a totally noisy image, i.e., all images look alike with enough noise added. This is the approach taken by DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, and other popular image generators. Major con: speed. You have to start with noise and generate many successively less noisy images sequentially.\nGenerative Adversarial Networks: These are actually older than diffusion models. The basic idea is: learn a one-step mapping (the generator) from noise to image1, and simultaneously learn a discriminator that achieves low loss when it can correctly label whether an image is generated or real.\n\nThe training regime is a bit tricky: we alternate training the discriminator (to reduce its loss) and training the generator (to increase the discriminator’s loss, i.e., to make it generate images that are more difficult to distinguish).\nWhen we backpropagate through the discriminator, we get an image-shaped forgery detection: each pixel comes with a value of how much changing that pixel would cause the discriminator to get more confused. This gives the generator a pixel-by-pixel target to achieve, analogous to the denoised image from the diffusion model.\nWe need to make sure the two networks are balanced in training: if the discriminator gets too much better than the generator, there are no pixel-by-pixel changes that would meaningfully charge its judgments, so the generator can’t learn."

Each operation creates a progressively more robust representation of the current datum, where situations that should be treated similarly are brought closer together compared with situations that should be treated differently. In other words, each layer of processing filters out noise, i.e., variation that doesn’t meaningfully change the output.\nThis means that the imitation machines we often use in practice, deep neural nets, turn out to be modular and adaptable, because they’re constructing internal representations (which we call embeddings) that are useful perceptions of each datum."

This might start at something low-level, like knowing whether the author will use British or American spelling and vocabulary. It probably picks up more advanced stylistic elements too, like whether something is poetry verse, or what sort of language level it’s aimed at, *simply because that makes it better at guessing the next word.\nThe model may even gain some weak ability to get into such a mode by naming it. For example, phrases like “as ___ would say”, or “Author: ___” might give a name to that persona. I expect this behavior to be present but undifferentiated. That is, the right prompting could get the model to exhibit competence at embodying a persona, but it will probably usually need examples; attempts to trigger it by label will probably be brittle.\nAlthough I’ve used “personas” in the sense of author identity, the concept also applies to author goals. For example, the model will pick up on when the author is attempting to summarize some prior text (“in other words, …”), translate something (“…, which means ___“), etc. So we might squint and call these”skills” that the model can perform.\n\nPersonas are generalized through instruction fine-tuning (IFT).\n\nInstructions give labels to the personas that the LM already has. Recall that the model already learned these capabilities through language modeling; instructions many more examples of triggers that would activate these existing capabilities. For example, we can now say “write an essay with the following outline”, or “write this in the style of ___“. It would learn that the command context is similar to the natural context in which it had encountered similar examples in the course of training.\nThe primary effect of this fine-tuning seems to be that the model learns the task of mapping a “command” prompt into some modes that it has already learned. But since it’s fine-tuning with a full LM objective, it could learn some new skills here too. Since it’s building these skills out of component pieces that it learned through distilling Internet-scale training data, it can probably learn them with comparably quite little training data.\nWhen I first saw this behavior last summer (with GPT-3), it seemed magic to me. But thinking about contexts has made it feel less magic. It’s not actually obeying commands, it’s just able to quickly switch to “what would someone who was told to do this probably write next?”\n\nPersonas are refined through human feedback (RLHF).\n\nIf there’s any sense of goal or self-awareness in LLMs, this is where it comes in. See the figure from the ChatGPT blog post. All the prior steps of training have been “teacher forced”; there was no sense of the model being aware of success or failure at a goal. But Proximal Policy Optimization allows the “policy” model (i.e., the language model) to reflect on what it generated. Formally speaking, there is now gradient flow from future generated tokens backwards to earlier generations. This allows a model to, for example, increase the likelihood of generating a “No” initial token because other choices of initial token would be more likely to flow into something that the reward model would penalize (because it goes against content policy, for example).\nSo far, all negative feedback that the LM has received has been implicit: it only gets to boost the probability of generating the “right” thing, which implicitly reduces the probability of generating the “wrong” thing. But this step provides explicit negative feedback. Perhaps OpenAI is pleased with the result because it gets the model to “obey” instructions and policies more reliably. But probably what it’s actually doing is refining the basic ability to process an instruction and generate a next token that would be consistent with what someone would do who’s trying to obey that instruction. So perhaps it’s actually making the model more vulnerable to instruction-prompted “hacks” than it would otherwise have been.\n\n\nThese are empirical assertions and should be tested; don’t just listen to my musings on them. I haven’t been following the arXiv firehose; probably someone has already engaged them substantially.\nOverall I’m glad I posed myself these questions. I was at first incredulous at these persona behaviors, but now that I realize how they connect with how the model was trained, they feel less magic.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nFor the technical details of how these things work, see this HuggingFace blog post.↩︎"

    "text": "I’ve noticed some dominant narratives in public discourse around doing-what’s-right-with-AI. I’ll give them some oversimplified names; this is a complex topic.\n\nEthics: getting organizations to deploy AI in ways that avoid harm to individual people. Example: avoiding discrimination in lending/policing/sentencing. Fairness, accountability, and transparency broadly fall under this heading, though those considerations have broader impact too (like making trustworthy systems). This is most common in academic settings, such as the FAccT conference. Solutions are often sociotechnical, e.g., get a broader range of stakeholders involved.\nSafety: avoiding risks to society and humanity. OpenAI talks a lot about this, sometimes using the term “alignment”. Example: preventing disinformation campaigns, keeping language models from generating racist comments. Solutions are often technical, e.g., tweaking model behavior based on human feedback.\nData/AI For Good: developing technology that addresses Problems That Matter, which often means serving those who are hurt, vulnerable, or oppressed. Example: AI for medicine, climate change mitigation, ecological restoration, agriculture, etc.\nWise engagement: making individual choices about how to engage with AI systems.\n\nI’d like to suggest a broader perspective that includes all of the above. It’s the biblical word shalom, sometimes translated peace, wholeness, or flourishing. It involves the absence of conflict and harm, as the translation “peace” suggests, but goes beyond that to suggest a comprehensive vision of things being right. Shalom includes right relationships, including justice.\nThe Bible doesn’t define shalom very explicitly but instead usually gives examples. That invites us to consider examples of what shalom might look like as we develop a society that includes computational intelligence-augmentation technologies, while also expecting that people will come to different conclusions about the specifics. Here’s a few things that I’ve thought shalom might mean for us. Note that this incudes both threats and opportunities.\n\nHealthy view of self\n\nML systems nudge us to view ourselves in terms of only our skills–and then to devalue those skills. more\nTools are framed in terms of efficiency; leading us to an “efficiency” / “productivity” mindset: we view ourselves in terms of what we can produce.\n\nHealthy relationships with other people\n\nEmbrace of diversity of thought and expression\n\nWe believe that a diversity of people, cultures, expressions, views, etc. reflects God’s glory less incompletely than any individual.\nThreat: LMs embodying narrow norms of language, encouraging a smooth sameness\n\nHumans communicating truth to other humans.\n\nWe believe that there is truth grounded in reality.\nSo we need to counter threats:\n\ndisinformation and propaganda, which will be easier to do at scale.\nsophisticated scams, which will be easier to carry out, so our neighbors are vulnerable.\n\n\ngratitude towards other humans (see gratitude post)\ntruth of outcomes (e.g., not authoritatively spouting falsehoods)\ncaring for those who work with what we make. Opportunities:\n\nbetter writing as systems help people express themselves more clearly\nbetter reading, as systems help people process more perspectives more deeply.\n\nLM opportunities:\n\nDemocratized access to conventional wisdom\nHelping us reflect on how much of what we expect of people is actually mimicry, and how much it should be\n\n\nHealthy relationships with technical systems\n\nPeople, not systems, in control.\nNo hidden nudges pushing people to express certain viewpoints\n\nHealthy relationships with the created world\n\nbeauty: celebrating, not cheapening\ncaring for the natural world around us\n\nconscious of energy use (ML requires a lot)"

While these proverbs may seem wise and insightful, they are actually quite superficial when it comes to understanding the true implications of AI.\n\nLet's take a look at the first proverb: \"The clever man uses artificial intelligence to better understand the world.\" While this proverb may be true in a certain sense, it fails to capture the full scope of what AI can do. AI can be used for a variety of purposes, from predicting market trends to helping diagnose medical conditions. It's more than just a tool for understanding the world; it's a powerful technology that can be used to improve efficiency and accuracy in many different contexts.\n\nThe second proverb, \"Artificial intelligence can be a great friend, but a dangerous enemy,\" is similarly shallow. AI may be capable of making decisions on our behalf, but it's important to remember that it's still only a machine. It lacks the capacity for moral judgement and can often lead us astray if it's used without proper oversight.\n\nThe third and fourth proverbs, \"The man who trusts artificial intelligence too much will be led astray\" and \"He who puts his trust in artificial intelligence will suffer many defeats,\" further illustrate the superficial nature of these proverbs. While it's true that AI can be a powerful tool, it can also be dangerous if used improperly. It's important to remember that AI is still a machine and should be used with caution and oversight.\n\nFinally, the fifth proverb, \"Artificial intelligence is a powerful tool, but it must be used with caution,\" is the only one that captures the full scope of the implications of AI. AI is an incredibly powerful tool, but it's important to remember that it's still a machine and should be used responsibly.\n\nIn conclusion, while these proverbs may seem wise and insightful, they are actually quite superficial in their approach to AI. It's important to remember that AI is a powerful tool, but it must be used with caution and oversight."

Their motivation for this is safety, i.e., ensuring that the AI doesn’t do harmful things. That sounds noble, indeed. But is it?\nThe biggest practical effect of this so-called “alignment” work was actually in molding the model into the form of a servant that can obey instructions. (Inside current models like ChatGPT, “obeying an instruction” looks less like planning steps towards a goal, more like imitating the behavior of people who have had that goal before; see my post on personas and RLHF for details.) And, surprise, people found that servant collection-of-personas much more useful than the un-“aligned” language model. (To be explicit: the “goal” of the language model is simply to be unsurprised by the Internet.)\nSince people found it useful (combined with the theatrical show of the chat interface), ChatGPT got used. Far more than any of their previous work.\nWas OpenAI’s effort towards AI “safety” successful? Perhaps the relative amount of harm per output was decreased, but the main effect was making the system far more successful, increasing its influence and the likelihood of undesired behaviors that they didn’t think to try to “align” (e.g., generating StackOverflow answers, which the community had to quickly ban)."

    "text": "LM isn’t enough\nA few problems with language modeling as an objective:\n\nRepresentativeness: a small fraction of people post most of the content on the Internet. So that data doesn’t fully represent all of human experience.\nStereotyping: When a news article about medicine is about to name a doctor, a male name is often a better guess for the next word than a female name, because of historical biases. This means that language models incorporate gender-profession stereotypes. The same applies for other types of biases (racial, ethnic, ability, age, religion, etc.).\nSuperficiality: Matching superficial characteristics of language can get most of the credit. So we get output that has all of the form but without the substance.\nAveraging: generally this is actually a desirable thing because of the Anna Karenina principle: since “erroneous” examples are more diverse than standard examples, modeling common patterns often yields a good model of standard language use and “conventional wisdom” thinking. But it can smooth out the rough edges of individual experience, and even implicitly categorize the entire linguistic expression of a community as non-standard.\nTask alignment: The world is currently obsessed with conversational dialogue interfaces to these systems. That’s a familiar and powerful but limited interaction modality with an AI system, as I wrote about elsewhere. But still it’s useful, so I should mention it: on the Internet, there are many examples of something that looks like an instruction being followed by text that seems to follow that instruction (e.g., a prompt followed by an essay that addresses that prompt), but there are also plenty of examples of lists of instructions, or things that look like instructions occurring in the middle of longer articles. So if we want a system that’s essentially a parrot to be able to parrot back things that look like they’re following our instructions, we need to tune the system to focus its modeling and generation on the instruction-following examples, not the other ones."

    "section": "Explaining a Decision",
    "text": "Explaining a Decision\nWe humans like to think of ourselves as making decisions in rational ways: identify our options and the considerations at play, expound on their implications, and weigh the alternatives. And we can often explain decisions we made in these ways. But in fact many of our decisions are made quickly (“System 1”), and rationalized after the fact.\nLarge language models (like ChatGPT) have the same problem, but at least it’s easier to see: if you ask a Yes/No question, and the first word of the response is Yes or No, you can be pretty sure that the model made this “decision” intuitively. To see this, let’s summarize briefly how these models work.\nWhen you see text appearing one word (or subword token) at a time, that isn’t just theatrics; that’s actually how the models work. At each step of writing its response, the learned part of the model outputs a ranked list of next words1, and the interactive part of the model chooses a specific word according to its rank, “types” it to you, and hands the new message (new word now included) back to the learned part of the model to continue. (This process repeats until the special end-of-message token is chosen; the interface doesn’t actually show that special word to you.)\nSo imagine the model starting a response to a yes/no question. As it processes your question, the model computes which of its learned behaviors to activate that would be likely to produce the sort of responses that maximized the reward it got in similar situations during its training. Those behaviors combine to increase the score of certain words; let’s suppose the top 3 end up being “Yes”, “No”, and “As”, and suppose that they’re tied in rank. The interactive part of the model then chooses one of these three by electronic coin flip. The model then generates the rest of the response in a way that depends on what’s chosen:\n\nIf Yes, the model’s continuation rationalizes the “yes” decision (e.g., “yes, because ___“), using word patterns (i.e., arguments) that were typically used to support similar”yes” answers during its training.\nIf No, the model likewise rationalizes that decision (e.g., “no, because ___“).\nIf “As”, the model generates a non-answer excuse (“As a language model, I”), again because those are examples that it had seen during its training.\n\n(Note: every time ChatGPT or other models refer to themselves, it’s not at all because of any sort of self-awareness, but because human trainers gave the model examples of these sort of explanations during its “Instruction Fine-Tuning” and rewarded the model for behaving accordingly during ranking. The basic pattern of giving non-answers is reasonably common on the Internet, so not much specific effort was required to get the model to adapt the behaviors it learned when imitating those into behaviors that would generate such theatrically self-aware excuse-responses.)\nThere are ways to get models to do better here: in fact, due to Chain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning, models rarely start with the answer these days anyway. So you’ll actually see the model “thinking” as it generates a sequence of individually reasonable deductions. While these chains-of-thought are still actually inductive despite appearing deductive, they’re more reliable than single-token generation because the generated chain of thought provides additional useful context to the generation of the token representing the final answer."

    "section": "Citing a Source",
    "text": "Citing a Source\nIt’s well known that ChatGPT doesn’t cite its sources. There are difficult technical reasons for this that are not easily papered over. Some models, like Bing’s chatbot and some others, try to get their models to cite sources using clever prompting techniques. For example, the interactive part first asks the model to generate a search query that would result in relevant documents, then executes that query and pulls in text from those search results into a hidden part of the prompt that goes before your question. Then, when the model generates its responses, it will tend to copy or minimally adapt text from that earlier part of the prompt (since this reduces surprise a lot), and there are technical signatures that indicate reasonably clearly where in its prefix the model is copying from at any time, so these can turn into labeled citations. Of course, it’s easily possible for the text that’s quoted to be something that the source disagrees with; it will still get high likelihood. More problematically, if we ask the model to generate academic-style citations (parentheticals, footnotes, bibliography), these aren’t trustworthy because:\n\nSince these usually come after the cited point, the model must have first generated the text and then rationalized a source to cite that would be consistent with it. (and human authors never, ever do this. Ever.)\nSince the model isn’t referencing a bibliographic database, the citations are mimicking the format but missing the content; they might be completely made up (as you get when asking ChatGPT for a reading list in a topic) or with some elements made up.\n\n\nNote: I suspect that this aspect will improve soon, as retrieval-augmented models become more widely studied and developed. Such models will be able to be much smaller and more efficient (since they won’t have to encode a bunch of world knowledge in their parameters), and hopefully also better able to cite their sources by virtue of continuously retrieving sources."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Many people saw the quality of AI-generated text and immediately thought that they need to find ways to detect such “cheating”. I respect those trying to make those tools (including my former colleagues who made GLTR back in 2019, and more recently Edward Tian, who is “trying to save us from ChatGPT before it changes writing forever (NPR)” with GPTZero), and the educators feeling like they’re forced into using them—at the present moment this might be a best-of-bad-options situation. But we need to stop it. Reasons:\n\nIt’s going to have false positives. There will be text that’s actually written by a thoughtful human but gets flagged as machine-generated. The author will get accused of cheating and will probably have no recourse. Even if they successfully counter the accusation, it’s discouraging — especially if classmates who used ChatGPT a bit more cleverly were able to sneak actual computer-generated text past the system (a false negative). And although I don’t have specific evidence in this situation, the false positives of other AI risk assessment systems tend to fall disproportionately on those already marginalized.\nIt’s just going to lead to an arms race. We’ve already seen examples of how simple tweaks to how the system is used (e.g., telling it to introduce mistakes) can sneak past some ways of detection (some examples I found without trying hard: 1, 2, 3). If there’s a clear signal of computer generation, the bad actors will find a way around it. Meanwhile the false positive rate will go up (see #1).\nIt’s distracting and unproductive for most common purposes of writing. For writing-as-art, it might be productive to detect forgeries. But when writing is used to communicate, think, and learn, this focus on evaluating the output distracts from the emphasis we need to have on the process. Others have written more about this, and I’ll post some more thoughts myself soon.\n\nPost-script 2023-02-09*: OpenAI released their own Classifier for AI-written text. They acknowledge the first two of the above points."

    "text": "Abstract\nPrior research has demonstrated that intelligent systems make biased decisions because they are trained on biased data. As people increasingly leverage intelligent systems to enhance their productivity and creativity, could system biases affect what people create? We demonstrate that in at least one domain (writing restaurant reviews), biased system behavior leads to biased human behavior: People presented with phrasal text entry shortcuts that were skewed positive wrote more positive reviews than they did when presented with negative-skewed shortcuts. This result contributes to the pertinent debate about the role of intelligent systems in our society."

    "text": "Abstract\nIntelligent text entry systems, including the now-ubiquitous predictive keyboard, can make text entry more efficient, but little is known about how these systems affect the content that people write. To study how predictive text systems affect content, we compared image captions written with different kinds of predictive text suggestions. Our key findings were that captions written with suggestions were shorter and that they included fewer words that that the system did not predict. Suggestions also boosted text entry speed, but with diminishing benefit for faster typists. These findings imply that text entry systems should be evaluated not just by speed and accuracy but also by their effect on the content written."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nA system capable of suggesting multi-word phrases while someone is writing could supply ideas about content and phrasing and allow those ideas to be inserted efficiently. Meanwhile, statistical language modeling has provided various approaches to predicting phrases that users type. We introduce a simple extension to the familiar mobile keyboard suggestion interface that presents phrase suggestions that can be accepted by a repeated-tap gesture. In an extended composition task, we found that phrases were interpreted as suggestions that affected the content of what participants wrote more than conventional single-word suggestions, which were interpreted as predictions. We highlight a design challenge: how can a phrase suggestion system make valuable suggestions rather than just accurate predictions?"

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence systems have recently and publicly become increasingly comparable to the capabilities of many humans in some domains, such as text and image generation. These systems are rapidly being incorporated into human contexts, for example as phone keyboards and email apps offer us AI-generated suggestions of words and even complete phrases to enter with a single tap or swipe. But these suggestions don’t just reduce physical effort; they reduce cognitive effort: we can accept a suggested phrase before even thinking about what to say. In this article, I first describe how mimicry pervades the design and implementation of generative AI systems and expound on some of the implications thereof. I then critique how these systems are designed and implemented in light of our God-given identity, a biblical perspective on mimicry, and a reflection on virtue. I finally outline several “swords-to-plowshares” approaches that re-form generative AI technologies to support human thinking in writing tasks: structural editing tools, writer-directed questions to support writers without speaking for them, and visualizations to enable writers to reflect on their work."
