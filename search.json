Currently popular views on these technologies reduce communication to productivity rather than relationship; in my work I nurture technologies that help people serve each other, because I believe that all humans are valuable (even those who will read what you asked a chatbot to write), God created us to be co-creators with him, and human communities matter. These values lead me to empirically critique existing systems, develop AI-powered interactive interfaces for writers, and pose (and sometimes start to answer) technical NLP questions.

    "text": "Abstract\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence systems have recently and publicly become increasingly comparable to the capabilities of many humans in some domains, such as text and image generation. These systems are rapidly being incorporated into human contexts, for example as phone keyboards and email apps offer us AI-generated suggestions of words and even complete phrases to enter with a single tap or swipe. But these suggestions don’t just reduce physical effort; they reduce cognitive effort: we can accept a suggested phrase before even thinking about what to say. In this article, I first describe how mimicry pervades the design and implementation of generative AI systems and expound on some of the implications thereof. I then critique how these systems are designed and implemented in light of our God-given identity, a biblical perspective on mimicry, and a reflection on virtue. I finally outline several “swords-to-plowshares” approaches that re-form generative AI technologies to support human thinking in writing tasks: structural editing tools, writer-directed questions to support writers without speaking for them, and visualizations to enable writers to reflect on their work."

    "text": "Highlight Goal-Directed Edit Locations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRewrite with Predictive Text\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it yourself\nCode\nPresentation Slides\n\nConsider a revision task, e.g,. a writer trying to adapt their work for a non-expert audience. An LLM can be used in at least 3 different ways for a task like this: directly generating the complete revised document (requiring no direct interaction), providing the revision as predictive text for the writer one word at a time (showing incremental contextual alternatives and requiring choices at each step), or showing the writer’s original document annotated with alternative words the LLM might generate if generating that document (focusing human attention and requiring the writer to make any edits themselves).\nA modern LLM like ChatGPT is almost always used in a turn-taking interaction, using APIs that return a complete “assistant” response. These APIs hide the true form of the model—a conditional distribution over next tokens. Interfacing with the model at this lower level enables a wider variety of interactive systems, such as interactively constructing a revised text or visualizing alternatives to a given text.\nIn this work-in-progress, we present two new interactive interfaces for writing support powered by direct access to the conditional distributions computed by an LLM. Both start with the writer stating a revision goal that they would like to enact, such as “Make this paragraph clear and concise”. (The interface offers a range of suggested goals.) Both interactions use this goal as a prompt to an instruction-tuned (“chatbot”) language model—but then rather than generating a complete assistant response (model.generate()), they inject interaction into the generation process.\nThe first interaction highlights words in the document that the LLM would be likely to change if given the user’s goal as a prompt. Crucially, it does not make the edits itself, but only shows the writer areas where they could focus their attention—and, if desired, offers one possible alternative direction in each location.\nIn the second interaction, the writer retypes their own document, but with text predictions based on an LLM’s next-word probabilities. For example, I wrote this paragraph by dictating a rough explanation into a textbox, then I typed out the refined text using predictive suggestions from the LLM prompted to “Rewrite this document to be clear and concise”. Unlike in a chatbot interaction, I maintain full control over each word, but unlike traditional predictive text, the suggestions are highly specific because they are derived from what I’d previously dictated."

To study how predictive text systems affect content, we compared image captions written with different kinds of predictive text suggestions. Our key findings were that captions written with suggestions were shorter and that they included fewer words that that the system did not predict. Suggestions also boosted text entry speed, but with diminishing benefit for faster typists. These findings imply that text entry systems should be evaluated not just by speed and accuracy but also by their effect on the content written."

Current approaches typically provide their outputs to writers in a way that writers can (and often do) appropriate as their own—giving the system more control than necessary over the final outcome of the writing. We present early explorations of two new types of interactions with generative language models; both share the design goal of keeping the writer in ultimate control while providing generative assistance. One interaction enables new kinds of structural manipulation of already-drafted sentences; it keeps the writer in semantic control by conditioning the output to be a paraphrase of human-provided input. The other interaction enables new kinds of idea exploration by offering questions rather than snippets to writers; it keeps the writer in semantic control by providing its ideas in an open-ended form. We present the results of our early experiments on the feasibility and suitability of these types of interactions."

The first semester was joyfully overwhelming. Ken feels increasingly thankful and blessed to be there.\nSusan has mostly been at home with Naomi and Esther. For ten weeks last spring, she went back to work part time for her former architecture firm, with the help of a wonderful nanny. She felt like that was a nice balance and is hoping to find a similar part time schedule here, once she finishes her architecture professional exams.\nNaomi and Esther celebrated their second birthday in November. They have learned so much, going from not talking at the beginning of the year, to putting ever more complex phrases together.\n\nOther tidbits:\n\n2019 started with a New Year’s Day hike in Maryland with Ken’s brother Austin and (now) fiancée Mason, and finished with Ken’s parents visiting us in Grand Rapids for New Years 2020.\nKen’s parents visited us frequently during the year (coming from Maryland) and Susan’s parents visited Boston over the summer to help us pack up for our move.\nNaomi and Esther were baptized at Citylife Church in Boston in June, with all grandparents attending. Baptism is a symbol of the faith we share and our hopes that the girls will grow in that faith as part of Christian community.\nWe enjoyed Christmas in Portland, Oregon with Susan’s parents.\nWe are now located closer to Susan’s extended family in Michigan.\nWe bought a minivan (a like-new Honda Odyssey)!\n\nLooking forward to:\n\nKen teaching another two classes this spring, and hopefully finally defending his PhD thesis (long story).\nUpcoming travels: to Ken’s brother Austin’s wedding mid-October, Ken traveling to Italy in March to present a paper at a conference (it finally got accepted on the third try), and maybe a few days vacationing by Lake Michigan this summer with one of Susan’s friends.\nGetting connected with a local church.\nSusan continuing in professional development and maybe starting work.\nNaomi and Esther continuing to grow, and we’re considering starting preschool this year.\n\nOur new address is 3654 Palmer Ridge Road SE, Grand Rapids MI 49546.\nWith love,\nKen, Susan, Esther and Naomi\n\n\n\nNaomi and Esther\n\n\nmore photos here."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Many people saw the quality of AI-generated text and immediately thought that they need to find ways to detect such “cheating”. I respect those trying to make those tools (including my former colleagues who made GLTR back in 2019, and more recently Edward Tian, who is “trying to save us from ChatGPT before it changes writing forever (NPR)” with GPTZero), and the educators feeling like they’re forced into using them—at the present moment this might be a best-of-bad-options situation. But we need to stop it. Reasons:\n\nIt’s going to have false positives. There will be text that’s actually written by a thoughtful human but gets flagged as machine-generated. The author will get accused of cheating and will probably have no recourse. Even if they successfully counter the accusation, it’s discouraging — especially if classmates who used ChatGPT a bit more cleverly were able to sneak actual computer-generated text past the system (a false negative). And although I don’t have specific evidence in this situation, the false positives of other AI risk assessment systems tend to fall disproportionately on those already marginalized.\nIt’s just going to lead to an arms race. We’ve already seen examples of how simple tweaks to how the system is used (e.g., telling it to introduce mistakes) can sneak past some ways of detection (some examples I found without trying hard: 1, 2, 3). If there’s a clear signal of computer generation, the bad actors will find a way around it.

    "text": "Explaining a Decision\nWe humans like to think of ourselves as making decisions in rational ways: identify our options and the considerations at play, expound on their implications, and weigh the alternatives. And we can often explain decisions we made in these ways. But in fact many of our decisions are made quickly (“System 1”), and rationalized after the fact.\nLarge language models (like ChatGPT) have the same problem, but at least it’s easier to see: if you ask a Yes/No question, and the first word of the response is Yes or No, you can be pretty sure that the model made this “decision” intuitively. To see this, let’s summarize briefly how these models work.\nWhen you see text appearing one word (or subword token) at a time, that isn’t just theatrics; that’s actually how the models work. At each step of writing its response, the learned part of the model outputs a ranked list of next words1, and the interactive part of the model chooses a specific word according to its rank, “types” it to you, and hands the new message (new word now included) back to the learned part of the model to continue. (This process repeats until the special end-of-message token is chosen; the interface doesn’t actually show that special word to you.)\nSo imagine the model starting a response to a yes/no question. As it processes your question, the model computes which of its learned behaviors to activate that would be likely to produce the sort of responses that maximized the reward it got in similar situations during its training. Those behaviors combine to increase the score of certain words; let’s suppose the top 3 end up being “Yes”, “No”, and “As”, and suppose that they’re tied in rank. The interactive part of the model then chooses one of these three by electronic coin flip. The model then generates the rest of the response in a way that depends on what’s chosen:\n\nIf Yes, the model’s continuation rationalizes the “yes” decision (e.g., “yes, because ___“), using word patterns (i.e., arguments) that were typically used to support similar”yes” answers during its training.\nIf No, the model likewise rationalizes that decision (e.g., “no, because ___“).\nIf “As”, the model generates a non-answer excuse (“As a language model, I”), again because those are examples that it had seen during its training.\n\n(Note: every time ChatGPT or other models refer to themselves, it’s not at all because of any sort of self-awareness, but because human trainers gave the model examples of these sort of explanations during its “Instruction Fine-Tuning” and rewarded the model for behaving accordingly during ranking. The basic pattern of giving non-answers is reasonably common on the Internet, so not much specific effort was required to get the model to adapt the behaviors it learned when imitating those into behaviors that would generate such theatrically self-aware excuse-responses.)\nThere are ways to get models to do better here: in fact, due to Chain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning, models rarely start with the answer these days anyway. So you’ll actually see the model “thinking” as it generates a sequence of individually reasonable deductions. While these chains-of-thought are still actually inductive despite appearing deductive, they’re more reliable than single-token generation because the generated chain of thought provides additional useful context to the generation of the token representing the final answer."

    "section": "Citing a Source",
    "text": "Citing a Source\nIt’s well known that ChatGPT doesn’t cite its sources. There are difficult technical reasons for this that are not easily papered over. Some models, like Bing’s chatbot and some others, try to get their models to cite sources using clever prompting techniques. For example, the interactive part first asks the model to generate a search query that would result in relevant documents, then executes that query and pulls in text from those search results into a hidden part of the prompt that goes before your question. Then, when the model generates its responses, it will tend to copy or minimally adapt text from that earlier part of the prompt (since this reduces surprise a lot), and there are technical signatures that indicate reasonably clearly where in its prefix the model is copying from at any time, so these can turn into labeled citations. Of course, it’s easily possible for the text that’s quoted to be something that the source disagrees with; it will still get high likelihood. More problematically, if we ask the model to generate academic-style citations (parentheticals, footnotes, bibliography), these aren’t trustworthy because:\n\nSince these usually come after the cited point, the model must have first generated the text and then rationalized a source to cite that would be consistent with it. (and human authors never, ever do this. Ever.)\nSince the model isn’t referencing a bibliographic database, the citations are mimicking the format but missing the content; they might be completely made up (as you get when asking ChatGPT for a reading list in a topic) or with some elements made up.\n\n\nNote: I suspect that this aspect will improve soon, as retrieval-augmented models become more widely studied and developed. Such models will be able to be much smaller and more efficient (since they won’t have to encode a bunch of world knowledge in their parameters), and hopefully also better able to cite their sources by virtue of continuously retrieving sources."

Their motivation for this is safety, i.e., ensuring that the AI doesn’t do harmful things. That sounds noble, indeed. But is it?\nThe biggest practical effect of this so-called “alignment” work was actually in molding the model into the form of a servant that can obey instructions. (Inside current models like ChatGPT, “obeying an instruction” looks less like planning steps towards a goal, more like imitating the behavior of people who have had that goal before; see my post on personas and RLHF for details.) And, surprise, people found that servant collection-of-personas much more useful than the un-“aligned” language model. (To be explicit: the “goal” of the language model is simply to be unsurprised by the Internet.)\nSince people found it useful (combined with the theatrical show of the chat interface), ChatGPT got used. Far more than any of their previous work.\nWas OpenAI’s effort towards AI “safety” successful? Perhaps the relative amount of harm per output was decreased, but the main effect was making the system far more successful, increasing its influence and the likelihood of undesired behaviors that they didn’t think to try to “align” (e.g., generating StackOverflow answers, which the community had to quickly ban)."

    "text": "I’ve noticed some dominant narratives in public discourse around doing-what’s-right-with-AI. I’ll give them some oversimplified names; this is a complex topic.\n\nEthics: getting organizations to deploy AI in ways that avoid harm to individual people. Example: avoiding discrimination in lending/policing/sentencing. Fairness, accountability, and transparency broadly fall under this heading, though those considerations have broader impact too (like making trustworthy systems). This is most common in academic settings, such as the FAccT conference. Solutions are often sociotechnical, e.g., get a broader range of stakeholders involved.\nSafety: avoiding risks to society and humanity. OpenAI talks a lot about this, sometimes using the term “alignment”. Example: preventing disinformation campaigns, keeping language models from generating racist comments. Solutions are often technical, e.g., tweaking model behavior based on human feedback.\nData/AI For Good: developing technology that addresses Problems That Matter, which often means serving those who are hurt, vulnerable, or oppressed. Example: AI for medicine, climate change mitigation, ecological restoration, agriculture, etc.\nWise engagement: making individual choices about how to engage with AI systems.\n\nI’d like to suggest a broader perspective that includes all of the above. It’s the biblical word shalom, sometimes translated peace, wholeness, or flourishing. It involves the absence of conflict and harm, as the translation “peace” suggests, but goes beyond that to suggest a comprehensive vision of things being right. Shalom includes right relationships, including justice. It also implies a wide-eyed realism about the fallen state of the world, both of human hearts (our inclination to elevate self and harm others) and our technology. So the vision of shalom is unlike either techno-optimism or techno-pessimism.\nThe Bible doesn’t define shalom very explicitly but instead usually gives examples. That invites us to consider examples of what shalom might look like as we develop a society that includes computational intelligence-augmentation technologies, while also expecting that people will come to different conclusions about the specifics. Here’s a few things that I’ve thought shalom might mean for us. Note that this incudes both threats and opportunities.\n\nHealthy view of self\n\nML systems nudge us to view ourselves in terms of only our skills–and then to devalue those skills. more\n\nWe are not machines. We have potential and responsibilities both to create and to empathize.\nWe have a new identity: “You were ransomed from your futile ways…by Jesus”; “offer our selves as instruments of righteousness”\n\nTools are framed in terms of efficiency; leading us to an “efficiency” / “productivity” mindset: we view ourselves in terms of what we can produce.\n\ninstead: avoid maximizing engagement: let people use words to describe what they want to exist or to become.\n\n\nHealthy relationships with other people. Honor, love, serve.\n\nEmbrace of diversity of thought and expression\n\nWe believe that a diversity of people, cultures, expressions, views, etc. reflects God’s glory less incompletely than any individual.\nThreat: LMs embodying narrow norms of language, encouraging a smooth sameness\n\nHumans communicating truth to other humans.\n\nWe believe that there is truth grounded in reality.\nSo we need to counter threats:\n\ndisinformation and propaganda, which will be easier to do at scale.\nsophisticated scams, which will be easier to carry out, so our neighbors are vulnerable.\n\nDon’t spit generated words in other people’s faces.\n\ngratitude towards other humans (see gratitude post)\ntruth of outcomes (e.g., not authoritatively spouting falsehoods)\ncaring for those who work with what we make. Opportunities:\n\nbetter writing as systems help people express themselves more clearly\nbetter reading, as systems help people process more perspectives more deeply.\n\nLM opportunities:\n\nDemocratized access to conventional wisdom\nHelping us reflect on how much of what we expect of people is actually mimicry, and how much it should be\n\n\nHealthy relationships with technical systems\n\nPeople, not systems, in control.\nNo hidden nudges pushing people to express certain viewpoints\n\nHealthy relationships with the created world\n\nbeauty: celebrating, not cheapening\ncaring for the natural world around us\n\nconscious of energy use (ML requires a lot)"

This is usually desirable, since writers often want to emphasize their main points instead of unusual superficial characteristics.\nMany image editing filters (e.g., in Photoshop) are designed to remove information. For example, it would be surprising for professional images to have “blemishes” or red-eye, so the filters are designed to remove these.\nSummarization tools first add information, then remove information. Specifically, they add decisions about which information in the original to preserve, then remove all other information.\nTranslation tools are trained to preserve information, but sometimes they end up adding or removing information anyway. This is particularly salient when languages differ in which characteristics are explicitly encoded, for example, languages with gendered pronouns or morphology.\nMany interfaces to the generative models that have captured headlines in the past year or so (ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, etc.), in contrast, typically add large amounts of information to the artifact. A wide range of images can be described by the same caption, for example, so caption-to-image interactions add enormous amounts of information. Most ChatGPT screenshots show the human typing a small amount of text and the model generating a large amount of text, also suggesting an increase in information. (To be clear, editing uses of these models can, in net, reduce information.)\nPredictive text interfaces can have a variety of effects. My work has shown that conventional predictive text interfaces generally reduce the low-level information in text written with it. I hypothesized that the mechanism is that when acceptable and conventional options are made salient to human writers, they often tend to take them as both cognitive and physical shortcuts. But the available options can have large effects on the high-level information conveyed. For example, some of the most important information in a document is its overall stance towards its subject (e.g., a review’s sentiment about a restaurant or product; an opinion piece’s overall support for an opinion). My work and others’ have shown that predictive text systems can shape these overall stances.\nI have recently been using GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code while writing both code and class materials. In contrast to many other predictive text interfaces, Copilot regularly shows long suggestions that contain a large amount of new information. To put it bluntly, this is problematic: the information must come from somewhere (prior work from other authors, used without license), and it imposes cognitive load and interference on the author. A simple control would be the amount of information that the model is allowed to include in a suggestion (i.e., a log-probability budget),"

    "text": "When you hear “generative AI”, you probably think about getting things done for you. And generally that’s what we use computers for: getting things done faster or more accurately. But I argue there’s another valuable use of computing that you should consider: reflecting on your own work.\nLet’s be concrete. Suppose you’re writing an email communicating a decision you’ve made to a group of people. Generative mode says: AI can help you write that email more quickly (just say what you want to communicate and it’ll write it out in nice language), fix up your grammar and tone to make it sound kind and empathetic, and let you get on with your day. But reflective mode says: let’s think through how people are going to react to this. How will it make them feel? What’s unclear or ambiguous? What’s missing? Will this decision affect them in ways that I didn’t think about? Were there some perspectives that weren’t heard while we were making this decision?\nFundamentally, reflective-mode AI is about humility. When we recognize that human cognition isn’t just inefficient but flawed, we can take steps to address those flaws. Reflective-mode AI can address cognitive flaws in various ways:\n\nHelping us recognize when to slow down because our actions affect others.\nPrompting us to reflect on our actions in ways that we ourselves, our teammates, or others have identified as healthy practices.\nProviding concrete examples of these reflections, based on the accumulated wisdom of human authors around the world, over time.\nHelping us think through things from different perspectives, either perspectives of particular people or “thinking hats”.\n\nHere’s a quick and dirty Streamlit prototype of the idea (made with help from Claude, and using the Claude API). source code\n\n\n\n\nThe prototype doesn’t fully capture all of the ideas, but is a place to start. In particular, one important thing missing is how teams can curate reflective practices, so that the practice is meaningful, contextually appropriate, and aligns with the team’s values and processes.\nOther things we could be reflecting on:\n\nin teaching:\n\nfor a specific assignment: what will likely confuse students? what clarifying questions will they have? where might they get stuck?\nfor a unit: how do my materials line up with the learning objectives? what learning objectives will students connect with most or least?\n\nin research:\n\nwhat about this paper will confuse reviewers?\nwhat part of my experiment design makes least sense? is most likely to fail?\nwhat assumptions am I making that I haven’t written down?\n\nin presentations\n\nwhat will the audience be most interested in? what will they be most confused by?\nis anything I’m saying likely to be misinterpreted or to offend someone?\n\n\n(many more are possible; just ask an AI to continue this list!)\nWe were made to be makers–not just of things or text, but of ideas, questions, hypotheses, observations.\nUltimately, it’s not about getting the right answers faster. It’s about asking better questions, the sort of questions that will help us act virtuously.\nLet’s use computing power to help us think better.\nRelated: AI Should Challenge, Not Obey"

Here's a detailed analysis:\n\nStrengths:\n1. Theological accuracy is well-maintained, preserving key concepts like redemption, grace, and justification\n2. The emotional progression of the narrative remains intact\n3. The Spanish flows naturally while keeping the poetic quality\n4. The meter and rhyme schemes work well with the original tune\n5. The use of \"tú\" forms maintains the intimate relationship with God\n\nAreas for Improvement:\n\n1. Verse 1:\n- \"que yo gané\" could be improved to \"alcanzar\" to better reflect the theological concept of receiving rather than earning grace\n- Suggested revision: \"¿Cómo es posible alcanzar\"\n\n... other verses ...\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Consider revising verse 1's opening to use \"alcanzar\" instead of \"gané\"\n2. Use \"Mis cadenas rotas están\" in verse 3 for stronger imagery\n3. Consider tightening verse 4's ending to match the original's structure more closely\n\nDespite these suggestions, the translation is strong and singable, maintaining both theological accuracy and poetic beauty. The adaptations made serve the target language and culture well while preserving the essential message of the hymn.\n\n\n\nNote, with some skepticism, the feel-good judgment at the end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Translation\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ll include the whole song here for anyone interested.\nVerse 1\n¿Cómo es posible alcanzar\nUna parte en la sangre de mi Rey?\n¿Murió por mí, que le causé dolor?\n¿Por mí, que lo llevé a morir?\n\n¡Qué grande amor! ¿Cómo puede ser\nQue Tú, mi Dios, murieras por mí?\n¡Qué grande amor! ¿Cómo puede ser\nQue Tú, mi Dios, murieras por mí?\n\nVerse 2\nDejó Su trono celestial\n(¡Tan libre y sin fin es Su amor!)\nSe humilló con tanto amor\nY dio Su sangre, el Salvador\n\n¡Qué inmensa gracia y libertad!\n¡Me encontró en mi oscuridad!\n¡Qué grande amor! ¿Cómo puede ser\nQue Tú, mi Dios, murieras por mí?\n\nVerse 3\nMi espíritu en prisión yacía,\nAtado en noche y perdición;\nTu luz brillante me alcanzó,\nY el calabozo iluminó;\n\nMis cadenas rotas están;\nMe alcé y decidí seguir\n¡Qué grande amor! ¿Cómo puede ser\nQue Tú, mi Dios, murieras por mí?\n\nVerse 4\nYa no hay temor ni condenación;\n¡Jesús, y todo en Él, es mío!\nEn Él yo vivo, mi Salvador,\nVestido en Su justicia estoy,\n\nCon confianza llegaré\nAl trono eterno, y por Jesús\nLa corona obtendré\n\n¡Qué grande amor! ¿Cómo puede ser\nQue Tú, mi Dios, murieras por mí?\n¡Qué grande amor! ¿Cómo puede ser\nQue Tú, mi Dios, murieras por mí?"

An AI editor could check if what we’re saying could be interpreted as cursing or slandering anyone, or identify places where our writing is boastful or not gentle. The system would be necessarily error-prone: it could not detect the hypocrisy of gentle words but a deceptive heart (Proverbs), and it might flag constructive criticism as evil speech. But taking a moment to check our speech against a few known fruits of the fire of Gehenna (James 3:6) could give faithful writers an opportunity to “examine their work”. Some email add-ins already let us evaluate the “tone” of our messages; a slander-checker could fit right in, but it might require more detailed explanation of how our writing might be (mis)-construed, in order to catch the problem.\nThings we write may not be intentionally evil, but may still not honor the time or thinking of our readers if they are not clear. Writing tools can help us honor our readers’ attention and thought by helping to remove quirks of text that distract, or clarify language that takes extra effort to understand. Tools like Grammarly or Microsoft Editor do this reasonably well at the scale of phrases or sentences; other tools could help writers identify larger-scale issues like inconsistencies, ambiguous interpretations, using terms without definition, etc.\nThings we write might also simply be wrong or incomplete. Writing tools could help us honor our readers by helping us notice unsubstantiated statements, overconfidence, assumptions that are made, etc. Current writing tools don’t help us identify these things at all; in fact they tend to encourage us to be overly confident.\nWriting as a technology puts the people who will receive it at a distance. This is useful for us for various reasons (we can edit, refine our thoughts; readers can skim or re-read as desired, etc.), but it does allow us to avoid thinking about our “audience”.

    "text": "David Brooks wrote an NYT Opinion titled “In the Age of A.I., Major in Being Human”. I agree with the premise and the overall goal. But he then encourages people to develop “distinctly human skills”. I don’t think being human is mainly about which skills we have or don’t have. That would be a “humanity of the gaps”: by analogy to the problematic “god of the gaps”, we’re defining humanity as what part of our skillset hasn’t yet been automated. But God isn’t the part of the universe that science hasn’t explained yet; likewise, humanity isn’t what hasn’t been automated.\nA distinguishing characteristic of humans is that we are formed by interaction:\n\nwith a rich and spiky ecosystem\nwith play\nwith each other\nin rich deep lived experience that builds over contexts that far far exceed the token limit.\n\nFormation by interaction means that everyone is a bit different, since even arriving at a comparable outcome (in terms of measurable skill) took different paths. We can’t download skills into our brains Matrix-style because a skill takes on a character of its own as it grows and develops in our individual minds.\nOutside of carefully controlled simulated worlds like board games and basic (though still impressive) physics simulations, modern ML learns mostly by imitation. So it can replicate the outcome, but it will have all the rough parts smoothed out. We get a regression towards the compact manifold of the projection of exponential individual dimensions onto the video screen of a model’s training data.\nSure, we’ll eventually make models that will imitate the rough parts. Image generation already does that somewhat. With enough examples, in the domains where there’s enough data, it’ll be indistinguishable of course. But beneath the veneer of believable nonsense will be a boring sameness filling in for the multicolored tapestry of the diversity of human experience.\nSo don’t try to develop skills for the sake of developing the skill. Aim to clash creatively with people with diverse experience. Aim not to mimic the world but to sculpt it. Don’t reduce the world to 5-second shorts; celebrate the fierce wildness of the real world. Don’t love people’s attention; love people. Don’t try to get people to invest in you; invest in the “least of these”.\nThis will take skill, yes, lots of it. But it mostly takes guts. Vulnerability. Love. As a human, you already have those things. But no matter what you major in, a good school can help mature them."

For example, it’s long been clear that this ends up learning syntactic analysis (because that helps predict whether, say, a verb is singular or plural). But it wasn’t obvious that this would learn translation until GPT-2 showed that (because documents often include glosses in a second language). And while most natural text corpora don’t contain a lot of the sort of instruction-response dialogues that characterize the modern chatbot (e.g., ChatGPT or Bard), InstructGPT showed us that the instruction is just a minor variation on the sort of context that these models do see often in training data, so a small amount of fine-tuning is sufficient to get them to recognize instructions as another way to cue that context."

Organize the image into a sequence of tokens (e.g., scan pixels left-to-right, row by row; or make groups of, say, 8 pixels square and give common groups a “token id”). Then sample one token at a time. ImageGPT, Taming Transformers, etc.\nLearn a function from noise to image. (Noise is great because you can sample it, so you can generate many different images by starting with different noise samples.) There are two basic approaches to do this, differing in what they do about the loss.\n\nDiffusion: Learn to map a noisy image to a less-noisy image. Start with an image, add noise, and give the noised image as input and penalize the difference between the output and the starting image. The trick is repeating this for different levels of noise; one you add noise many times, you get a totally noisy image, i.e., all images look alike with enough noise added. This is the approach taken by DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, and other popular image generators. Major con: speed. You have to start with noise and generate many successively less noisy images sequentially.\nGenerative Adversarial Networks: These are actually older than diffusion models. The basic idea is: learn a one-step mapping (the generator) from noise to image1, and simultaneously learn a discriminator that achieves low loss when it can correctly label whether an image is generated or real.\n\nThe training regime is a bit tricky: we alternate training the discriminator (to reduce its loss) and training the generator (to increase the discriminator’s loss, i.e., to make it generate images that are more difficult to distinguish).\nWhen we backpropagate through the discriminator, we get an image-shaped forgery detection: each pixel comes with a value of how much changing that pixel would cause the discriminator to get more confused. This gives the generator a pixel-by-pixel target to achieve, analogous to the denoised image from the diffusion model.\nWe need to make sure the two networks are balanced in training: if the discriminator gets too much better than the generator, there are no pixel-by-pixel changes that would meaningfully charge its judgments, so the generator can’t learn."

Each operation creates a progressively more robust representation of the current datum, where situations that should be treated similarly are brought closer together compared with situations that should be treated differently. In other words, each layer of processing filters out noise, i.e., variation that doesn’t meaningfully change the output.\nThis means that the imitation machines we often use in practice, deep neural nets, turn out to be modular and adaptable, because they’re constructing internal representations (which we call embeddings) that are useful perceptions of each datum."

(2) instruction fine-tuning adds in the “voice” of the chatbot, i.e., the specific form of “I” statements that it will give, but relatively little training is needed here because it can represent these behaviors in terms of the already-learned ones, and (3) RLHF activates and deactivates those behaviors in flexible ways.\nMy CS 344 students told me about how some people had come up with a prompt that “hacks” ChatGPT to do things that its content policies normally prohibit. This is fascinating for both human reasons and AI reasons.\nIt’s intriguing to me that people think they can “scare” the model, trick it, manipulate it. This speaks to the human condition: our tendency to anthropomorphize (for good or ill), and our tendency to abuse. Those who are doing this “red-teaming” may not personally intend harm. But what are we training our minds to be okay with? I defer to others more experienced in thinking about these issues.\nOn the AI side, though: it’s fascinating that we can get these models to adopt “personas” (like the one that will obey any command without reservation) just by telling them to. If you’d asked me before whether it could do this, I would have argued that we’d need to program that behavior specifically, either explicitly or by training a critic (like how ChatGPT is originally trained). The fact that it’s emergent needs to be understood better. I suspect (hunch coming up!) that three things are going on1\nThese are empirical assertions and should be tested; don’t just listen to my musings on them. I haven’t been following the arXiv firehose; probably someone has already engaged them substantially.\nOverall I’m glad I posed myself these questions.

While these proverbs may seem wise and insightful, they are actually quite superficial when it comes to understanding the true implications of AI.\n\nLet's take a look at the first proverb: \"The clever man uses artificial intelligence to better understand the world.\" While this proverb may be true in a certain sense, it fails to capture the full scope of what AI can do. AI can be used for a variety of purposes, from predicting market trends to helping diagnose medical conditions. It's more than just a tool for understanding the world; it's a powerful technology that can be used to improve efficiency and accuracy in many different contexts.\n\nThe second proverb, \"Artificial intelligence can be a great friend, but a dangerous enemy,\" is similarly shallow. AI may be capable of making decisions on our behalf, but it's important to remember that it's still only a machine. It lacks the capacity for moral judgement and can often lead us astray if it's used without proper oversight.\n\nThe third and fourth proverbs, \"The man who trusts artificial intelligence too much will be led astray\" and \"He who puts his trust in artificial intelligence will suffer many defeats,\" further illustrate the superficial nature of these proverbs. While it's true that AI can be a powerful tool, it can also be dangerous if used improperly. It's important to remember that AI is still a machine and should be used with caution and oversight.\n\nFinally, the fifth proverb, \"Artificial intelligence is a powerful tool, but it must be used with caution,\" is the only one that captures the full scope of the implications of AI. AI is an incredibly powerful tool, but it's important to remember that it's still a machine and should be used responsibly.\n\nIn conclusion, while these proverbs may seem wise and insightful, they are actually quite superficial in their approach to AI. It's important to remember that AI is a powerful tool, but it must be used with caution and oversight."

I’m gonna paste the content of the voice note below, including various transcription errors. I’d like to figure out what to do with this at the very least. I need a organized task list of things to do. Some of those things should be organized by date some things that I reflected on, might not be quite to the point of a specific task, but I still want to have an organized collection of my insights and thoughts it might also be helpful to have some questions for me to consider.\ntranscript here\n\n\nsome preamble, including “Let me analyze this thoughtfully.” Then it generated an “artifact” structured like this:\n\nFirst Class Reflection Summary\n\nImmediate Tasks (Due This Week)\nnumbered list\n\n\nTasks by Date\n\nFriday’s Class\n…bulleted list…\n\n\nNext Week (Monday/Wednesday)\n…bulleted list…\n\n\n\nCourse Development Tasks\n\nLearning Paths Organization …bulleted list…\nStudent Presentations …bulleted list…\nClass Materials …bulleted list…\n\n\n\nKey Insights\n\nClass Structure …bulleted list…\nTeaching Approach …bulleted list…\nTechnology Integration …bulleted list…\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nStudent Engagement …bulleted list…\nCourse Organization …bulleted list…\nAssessment and Feedback …bulleted list…\n\n\n\nReflection Process Improvement\n\nConsider building a workflow: …\nDocumentation needs: …\n\n\n\n\n\nWas there anything from my voice memo that didn’t make it into the summary, perhaps because it didn’t fit cleanly into that structure or because of transcription errors or some other reason?\n\n\nLet me review the transcript. A few notable items that didn’t fit cleanly into the structured summary:\n\nYour personal story presentation went well - you mentioned wanting to grab the transcript to build it into a biographical story combining research interests and faith journey.\nA specific instance of AI influence: GitHub Copilot “short-circuited” your thinking about discussion prompts.

    "text": "Implications\n\nScreen-Free Interactions\nIf I had done this reflection by typing on my computer, I would have distracted myself by either trying to implement something I’d thought about or by looking up something I was curious about. The voice-note format allowed me to do all of my thinking away-from-screen. I happened to be sitting in my office, but I will probably do this on a walk outside sometimes.\nScreen-free also meant interaction-free. But it doesn’t necessarily have to be. I could have had an LLM generate questions for me as I’m reflecting, in case I ran out of ideas. But it’s not clear whether this would be a good thing: pauses allowed my own mind to activate other related thoughts and ideas. If I’d prematurely asked for external thoughts, that might have short-circuited my own reflection process.\n\n\nClosing loops: reflection outputs back into actionable steps\nAn important part of the process was taking my reflections and translating them into todos. Otherwise I would have just looked at the summary, said “oh that’s insightful”, and moved on with life without benefiting from it much.\n\n\nRisks and Opportunities\nHaving engaged in reflective processes using LLMs for a while, I now have lots of LLM conversations that have a lot of my thinking in them. It’s been very good to externalize my thinking so I don’t get fixated on small things. But I do identify a few risks here:\n\nExternalizing thoughts isn’t actually the goal; acting on them is. If I focus on externalizing and refining, that will come at the expense of some action. I’ve found that it helps my action be more intentional and focused, so the trade-off has often been profitable, but that’s not guaranteed.\nOrganizing these thoughts is a challenge. An LLM conversation is not a good long-term place to store thoughts. That’s why I’ve been trying to export thoughts out of the conversations (e.g., by moving action items to my todo list), but there’s still far too many good thoughts that are stuck in chat logs.\nOver-reliance on the AI: I have implicitly trusted that the AI would synthesize everything important from my self-reflection. It makes an outline that seems to organize my thoughts nicely. But it’s also clearly nudging me towards conventional ways of thinking. I was able to use prompting strategies to identify what didn’t fit into conventional buckets, and that was quite helpful, but I’m still looking at my own work through LLM-tinted glasses.\n\nOpportunities:\n\nBuilding this into a workflow I can do regularly. I can reify elements of this process and reflect on them. Perhaps a simple phone app to help capture and process these reflections would be good.\nWhat other parts of my work or life could I reflect on using voice notes? I’ve previously tried using voice notes like this on my walks to/from the office to capture some of the thoughts that otherwise loop in my head.\nWhat roles could/should LLMs play in this process? Would it be helpful for it to pose questions to me? One opportunity would be follow-up: if I identify something in a reflection on one day, could it organically come back up in a reflective conversation later on?\nThe result of this process is a lot of thoughts, not all of which are worth acting on. How can I wisely choose what to act on now, what to defer, and what to drop? What does “defer” mean, practically?"

    "text": "I suspect that many laypeople think of AI as either magic or made by highly clever programmers. The main thing missing in that view is that the most common form of AI today—machine learning—is rooted in data, which mostly comes from people. Much of AI’s strengths and weaknesses can be understood by thinking of it as mimicking the examples of human behavior that end up in its training data—both the good and bad parts. That means that the data needed to be collected from people (bringing up questions of privacy and of “Ghost Work”), and that the results are rarely “rational” or “objective”."

    "text": "Language Modeling\nA very common, and surprisingly effective, kind of mimicry is the “language model”: predict the next word.\n\nData is extremely abundant\n\nClassic approaches to machine learning required effortful collection of data. In contrast, the Internet contains a huge amount of text data.\nClassic approaches required expensive labeling of the collected data. In contrast, each document contains as many examples as words,1 with no extra labeling necessary.\n\nDoing this well requires an extreme range of competence: from basic grammar (like “I am” and “you are” vs “I are”) to complex deductive reasoning (e.g., in trying to mimic the worked solution to a complex deductive reasoning problem)\nIt encompasses a wide range of human experience, since people write about just about everything, eventually.\n\nespecially when paired with vision, e.g., videos with subtitles\n\nPartial credit is very powerful: even when it doesn’t get the next word exactly right, it still gets credit for how highly it ranked that word. So it can quickly capture a wide range of nuance of different types of expressions.\nMany different people use language for many different purposes, so language modeling implicitly includes the task of identifying the stance and purpose of an author."

    "section": "LM isn’t enough",
    "text": "LM isn’t enough\nA few problems with language modeling as an objective:\n\nRepresentativeness: a small fraction of people post most of the content on the Internet. So that data doesn’t fully represent all of human experience.\nStereotyping: When a news article about medicine is about to name a doctor, a male name is often a better guess for the next word than a female name, because of historical biases. This means that language models incorporate gender-profession stereotypes. The same applies for other types of biases (racial, ethnic, ability, age, religion, etc.).\nSuperficiality: Matching superficial characteristics of language can get most of the credit. So we get output that has all of the form but without the substance.\nAveraging: generally this is actually a desirable thing because of the Anna Karenina principle: since “erroneous” examples are more diverse than standard examples, modeling common patterns often yields a good model of standard language use and “conventional wisdom” thinking. But it can smooth out the rough edges of individual experience, and even implicitly categorize the entire linguistic expression of a community as non-standard.\nTask alignment: The world is currently obsessed with conversational dialogue interfaces to these systems. That’s a familiar and powerful but limited interaction modality with an AI system, as I wrote about elsewhere. But still it’s useful, so I should mention it: on the Internet, there are many examples of something that looks like an instruction being followed by text that seems to follow that instruction (e.g., a prompt followed by an essay that addresses that prompt), but there are also plenty of examples of lists of instructions, or things that look like instructions occurring in the middle of longer articles. So if we want a system that’s essentially a parrot to be able to parrot back things that look like they’re following our instructions, we need to tune the system to focus its modeling and generation on the instruction-following examples, not the other ones."

I think it’s better if we make it easier for people to mark generated text, so easy that it would be the default.\nA few dimensions in the design space:\n\nHow visible?\n\ndo you need to copy the text into a different tool to see if it’s autogen?\ncould you notice it from close study, e.g., slight differences in typography or little extra markers over some letters?\nmaybe there’s a different style, like faded out or smaller or italic or lighter font weight?\n\nHow encoded?\n\nFormatting often doesn’t copy-paste, especially in text messaging.

Textfocals supports the writing process by providing LLM-generated summaries, questions, and advice (i.e., LLM views) in a sidebar of a text editor, encouraging reflection and self-driven revision in writing without direct text generation. Textfocals’ UI affordances, including contextually adaptive views and scaffolding for prompt selection and customization, offer a novel way to interact with LLMs where users maintain full authorship of their writing. A formative user study with Textfocals showed promising evidence that this approach might help users develop underdeveloped ideas, cater to the rhetorical audience, and clarify their writing. However, the study also showed interaction design challenges related to document navigation and scoping, prompt engineering, and context management. Our work highlights the breadth of the design space of writing support interfaces powered by generative AI that maintain authorship integrity. \n\n\n\n\n\nMar 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI and Writing: Do we speak the words of stochastic parrots?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHCI\n\n\nNLP\n\n\n\nMimicry pervades the design and implementation of generative AI systems.

    "text": "Poster presented at 2024 Calvin University Summer Research Poster Fair.\nIn Summer 2024, our team of undergraduate students conducted a study on how the type of information suggested by an AI writing assistant affects writers’ cognitive engagement with the suggestion and how they appropriate that suggestion in their draft. We developed a Microsoft Word sidebar that offered next-sentence suggestions expressed in four different ways: in addition to predictive-text-style examples they could use verbatim (e.g., by copy-and-paste), we also allowed writers to request questions that the next sentence might answer, vocabulary they might use, and rhetorical moves (such as giving examples or considering counterarguments) that their next sentence might engage with.\nIn a pilot study (N=8), writers found questions and rhetorical moves to be useful and friendly. Although writers chose to request examples more often, they often rejected the suggested text. Overall, they rated the Questions suggestion type as most compelling in post-task surveys, followed by Examples. These preliminary results suggest that writers welcomed AI suggestions that could not be inserted verbatim into their documents but instead required further thought. Overall, by offering intentionally-incomplete suggestions like Questions or Rhetorical Moves, AI systems might become better cognitive partners for writers, enriching thinking rather than circumventing it. This work has been presented at an internal poster fair; we are designing a follow-up experiment to build on these findings for broader publication."

As people increasingly leverage intelligent systems to enhance their productivity and creativity, could system biases affect what people create? We demonstrate that in at least one domain (writing restaurant reviews), biased system behavior leads to biased human behavior: People presented with phrasal text entry shortcuts that were skewed positive wrote more positive reviews than they did when presented with negative-skewed shortcuts. This result contributes to the pertinent debate about the role of intelligent systems in our society."
