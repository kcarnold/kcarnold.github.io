## Short

Associate professor of computer science and data science at Calvin University. Crafting tools to augment intelligence, teaching students to build and use tech wisely.

## Medium

Ken Arnold is an associate professor of computer science and data science at Calvin University. His research has shown how predictive text interfaces shape human communication. His current research interests include human-AI interaction in communication, creativity, and education. He holds advanced degrees from Harvard and MIT.

## Longer

Ken Arnold is an associate professor of computer science and data science at Calvin University. His research has shown how predictive text interfaces, like those in smartphones and email apps, can shape the content of human communication. He is currently developing intelligence augmentation to help writers serve readers by crafting words that are fully their own. His other research interests include human-AI interaction in communication, creativity, and education. He holds advanced degrees from Harvard and MIT.

## Alternative

I develop, study, and teach about AI technologies that impact how humans communicate with each other (e.g., predictive text, chatbots). Currently popular views on these technologies reduce communication to productivity rather than relationship; in my work I nurture technologies that help people serve each other, because I believe that all humans are valuable (even those who will read what you asked a chatbot to write), God created us to be co-creators with him, and human communities matter. These values lead me to empirically critique existing systems, develop AI-powered interactive interfaces for writers, and pose (and sometimes start to answer) technical NLP questions. I also teach AI, ML, and data science at an undergraduate and graduate level at Calvin University.
