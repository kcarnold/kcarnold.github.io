abstract: "Computational models of language have the exciting potential to help writers generate and express their ideas. Current approaches typically provide their outputs to writers in a way that writers can (and often do) appropriate as their own---giving the system more control than necessary over the final outcome of the writing. We present early explorations of two new types of interactions with generative language models; both share the design goal of keeping the writer in ultimate control while providing generative assistance. One interaction enables new kinds of structural manipulation of already-drafted sentences; it keeps the writer in semantic control by conditioning the output to be a paraphrase of human-provided input. The other interaction enables new kinds of idea exploration by offering questions rather than snippets to writers; it keeps the writer in semantic control by providing its ideas in an open-ended form. We present the results of our early experiments on the feasibility and suitability of these types of interactions."

## Abstract

Computational models of language have the exciting potential to help writers generate and express their ideas. Current approaches typically provide their outputs to writers in a way that writers can (and often do) appropriate as their own---giving the system more control than necessary over the final outcome of the writing. We present early explorations of two new types of interactions with generative language models; both share the design goal of keeping the writer in ultimate control while providing generative assistance. One interaction enables new kinds of structural manipulation of already-drafted sentences; it keeps the writer in semantic control by conditioning the output to be a paraphrase of human-provided input. The other interaction enables new kinds of idea exploration by offering questions rather than snippets to writers; it keeps the writer in semantic control by providing its ideas in an open-ended form. We present the results of our early experiments on the feasibility and suitability of these types of interactions.
