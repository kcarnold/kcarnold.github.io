Ken Arnold is an assistant professor of Computer Science and Data Science at
[Calvin University](https://cs.calvin.edu).
His research focuses on how data-driven intelligent systems can support human creative productivity and learning.
His teaching seeks to cultivate communities of learners who engage data and computation with both technical maturity and contextual thoughtfulness.
His doctoral work at Harvard University, advised by Prof. Krzysztof Gajos, was on how predictive text affects what people write.

## Doing research with me

I welcome students who are interested in human-computer interaction, machine learning, data science, interactive visualization, and Christian perspectives on data and computation. I have a range of ideas and ongoing projects, but bring your own interests too! Please contact me via email (Calvin: ka37) or Teams.
