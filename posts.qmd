I'm Ken Arnold, and I'm interested in research and teaching at the intersection of data science, people, and Christian faith.

Some of my current projects:

- Applying today's large AI language models to Help writers -- but without putting words in their mouth the way predictive text does.
- Augmenting instructors to have better views of what their students are actually learning.
- Helping Christians understand what AI can do, and accurately calibrating both our excitement and our concerns.
