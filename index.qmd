:::

I'm Ken Arnold, and I'm interested in research and teaching at the intersection of data science, people, and Christian faith.

My main projects are around **AI for Everyday Creativity**, including:

- Applying today's large AI language models to help writers -- but without putting words in their mouth the way predictive text does.
- Augmenting instructors to have better views of what their students are actually learning.
- Helping everyone understand what AI can do, and accurately calibrating both our excitement and our concerns.

## Teaching

I teach computer science, data science, and machine learning. Recent classes:

- [DATA 202 Data Science 2](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/data/202/), a data wrangling, predictive modeling, and visualization course using the R tidyverse, with a project emphasis
- [CS 344 Artificial Intelligence](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/344/), an applications-first machine learning course based on the [fast.ai course](https://course.fast.ai/)
- [CS 108 Introduction to Computing](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/108/) and CS 106, Calvin's first-year Computer Science course, in Python.
- INFO 602 Predictive Analytics (for Calvin's MBA program)

See CV for others.

## Doing research with me

I welcome students who are interested in human-computer interaction, machine learning, data science, interactive visualization, and Christian perspectives on data and computation. I have a range of ideas and ongoing projects, but bring your own interests too! Please contact me via email (Calvin: ka37) or Teams.
