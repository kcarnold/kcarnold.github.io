- title: "On Suggesting Phrases vs. Predicting Words for Mobile Text Composition"
  date: 2016-10-16
  authors: ["KC Arnold", "KZ Gajos", "AT Kalai"]
  publication: "In *Proceedings of the 29th Annual Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology*, UIST '16"
  publication_short: "In *UIST'16*"
  abstract: "A system capable of suggesting multi-word phrases while someone is writing could supply ideas about content and phrasing and allow those ideas to be inserted efficiently. Meanwhile, statistical language modeling has provided various approaches to predicting phrases that users type. We introduce a simple extension to the familiar mobile keyboard suggestion interface that presents phrase suggestions that can be accepted by a repeated-tap gesture. In an extended composition task, we found that phrases were interpreted as suggestions that affected the content of what participants wrote more than conventional single-word suggestions, which were interpreted as predictions. We highlight a design challenge: how can a phrase suggestion system make valuable suggestions rather than just accurate predictions? "

- title: "Sentiment Bias in Predictive Text Recommendations Results in Biased Writing"
  date: "2018-05-08"
  authors: ["KC Arnold", "K Chauncey", "KZ Gajos"]
  publication: "In *Graphics Interface 2018*."
  publication_short: "In *GI2018*"
  abstract: "Prior research has demonstrated that intelligent systems make biased decisions because they are trained on biased data. As people increasingly leverage intelligent systems to enhance their productivity and creativity, could system biases affect what people create? We demonstrate that in at least one domain (writing restaurant reviews), biased system behavior leads to biased human behavior: People presented with phrasal text entry shortcuts that were skewed positive wrote more positive reviews than they did when presented with negative-skewed shortcuts. This result contributes to the pertinent debate about the role of intelligent systems in our society."
