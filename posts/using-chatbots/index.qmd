Even if you're not [using AI in reflective mode](/posts/reflective-ai/), I suggest a few principles for having conversations with chatbots.

- **Recollection**. It’s an idol factory. So seek God the wonderful counselor before, during, and after. Ascribe insights to him, not to the AI. Desire his honor and kingdom first.
- *Cognitive engagement*: don’t get distracted.
- *Integrity*. Assume it’s public. Behave in a way that you want other people and other models to learn from.
- *Humility*. Assume both it and you are not just wrong but not even asking the right questions. *Prompt for alternative perspectives*.
- Keep it from doing things for you that you should do yourself. ("Don't write for me, instead, ...")


Here's how Claude summarized the way that I use chatbots:

-   Supporting reflective and meta-reflective practice 
    -   Synthesizing voice memos and identifying follow-up tasks and insights 
    -   Reflect on how to improve prompts 
    -   Prompt for areas of low confidence 
-   Iterative exploration 
    -   Refining rough ideas 
    -   Trying different organizational structures 
    -   Many conversations are many steps not one-shot interactions (build on, challenge, iteratively refine an artifact 
-   Teaching 
    -   Analyze alignment between objectives and materials 
    -   Iterating on course structure, progression, policies, assessments 
    -   Suggest reflection questions for students 
    -   Identifying materials in my library that can support my current objectives 
    -   Exploring ways to scaffold student learning 
    -   Identifying potential confusions, misunderstandings, or difficulties 
-   Translation (for multilingual hospitality at church) 
    -   Theological sensitivity 
    -   Back-translation to verify accuracy 
    -   Consideration of singability of song translations
