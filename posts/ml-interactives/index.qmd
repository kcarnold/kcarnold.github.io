As I've been teaching AI / Machine Learning, I've made a few interactive demos to help students understand some concepts. Here's a few:

- [ReLU interactive](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/375/24sp/fundamentals/u04n00-relu.ipynb) (name: `u04n00-relu.ipynb`; show [preview](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/375/24sp/fundamentals/u04n00-relu.html), open in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Calvin-Data-Science/cs375-376-public/blob/main/notebooks/u04n00-relu.ipynb))
- [Softmax / Cross Entropy](https://observablehq.com/@kcarnold/softmax)
