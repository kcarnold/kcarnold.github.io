*Shalom* includes right relationships, including justice.

- Humans communicating truth to other humans.
- People, not systems, in control.
- No hidden nudges pushing people to express certain viewpoints
- Embrace of diversity of thought and expression (manifold image of God)
- *gratitude* towards other humans
- caring for those who work with what we make
- truth of outcomes (e.g., not authoritatively spouting falsehoods)
- beauty: celebrating, not cheapening
- relationships
