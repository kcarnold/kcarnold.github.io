- Writing
    - instead of "content production"
    - what if AI systems could help with navigating a document, giving feedback, executing edits that the user requests, etc.
- Decisions
    - instead of making decisions for (or about) people
    - AI systems could help people make decisions by bringing awareness to important aspects, identifying exemplars from past experience, etc.
- Teaching
    - instead of building an artificial tutor
    - AI systems could help people teach by helping instructors understand what students are struggling with, providing feedback on teaching materials, helping differentiate instruction, etc.
- Governance
    - instead of codifying rules into automation
    - AI systems could help bring constituents' perspectives into the decision-making process


Other design considerations:

- Autocomplete: commands/style, not content
- Visualize complex collections and artifacts using *selective attention* not *select/summarize/regenerate*
- Provide control over *views* instead of *automatic* adjustments
- Blanks instead of guesses
- AI saying "what someone in this role might say" instead of taking on first-person personas
- AI checking and facilitating human work, not humans checking AI work.
    - suggestiong high-level editing actions instead of making the edits
    - visualizing examples / documentation instead of generating target content based on them.
    - help people identify faults that recent changes might have introduced
