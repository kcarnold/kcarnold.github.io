## Example

Yesterday I had the first meeting of my class on AI and machine learning. After class, I sat down away from my computer, closed the door, started a voice memo recording on my phone, and monologued my reflections from the class:

- what happened, what worked and didn't, and what I thought about it
- follow-ups I need to do
- questions about how to practically work out things that I've been thinking about
- reflections on my own process for preparing the class
- ideas for what to do in upcoming classes
- etc.

Since I was not in front of a screen, I was not distracted, and I had a lot of thoughts in the 35 minutes that the voice memo recorded.

Then, to turn my reflections into action:

1. I copied the transcript that my iPhone generated of my voice note (transcription errors and all).
2. I pasted the transcript into a new Claude conversation (in my Project about planning this course, although that probably didn't matter) and added a brief spec on what I wanted the LLM to do with my reflection.
3. After it generated the summary I wanted, I asked for anything that the summary didn't capture.
4. I went back to the computer and, exercising some self-control to not immediately act on things, updated my todo list according to the tasks that I had identified on.

Then I did what I said I needed to do.


## The Conversation

::: {.conversation}

::: {.human}
I just had my first meeting of my AI and machine learning class, and I sat down with a voice note to debrief the experience. I’m gonna paste the content of the voice note below, including various transcription errors. I’d like to figure out what to do with this at the very least. I need a organized task list of things to do. Some of those things should be organized by date some things that I reflected on, might not be quite to the point of a specific task, but I still want to have an organized collection of my insights and thoughts it might also be helpful to have some questions for me to consider.

Was there anything from my voice memo that didn't make it into the summary, perhaps because it didn't fit cleanly into that structure or because of transcription errors or some other reason?

::: {.assistant}
Let me review the transcript. A few notable items that didn't fit cleanly into the structured summary:

1. Your personal story presentation went well - you mentioned wanting to grab the transcript to build it into a biographical story combining research interests and faith journey.

2. A specific instance of AI influence: GitHub Copilot "short-circuited" your thinking about discussion prompts. This could be a valuable teaching example.

3. A detailed interaction with student *...* who kicked off discussion about AI in writing - this specific example of productive class discussion could inform future session planning.

4. An idea about using AI to estimate timing for class activities and anticipate student questions/thoughts.

## Implications

- screen-free interactions
- closing loops: reflection outputs back into actionable steps
- risk of over-reflection; analysis paralysis
